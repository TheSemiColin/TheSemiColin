# 💫 About Me:
I am a current Junior at Vanderbilt University majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics, and minoring in Computer Science, with a concentrations in Embedded Systems and Artificial Intelligence.<br><br>I have been intrigued by software development and its intersection with hardware ever since I started learning about the basic architecture of a computer from YouTube videos. Once I was introduced to an Arduino during my senior year of high school, is sparked my love and passion for the field of software development, which has grown ever since.<br>

# 🚀 What I'm Up To:
- Currently exploring Machine Learning with Tensorflow and Tensorflow Lite!
- Member of the Vandy Robotics Team in the Programming subteam, discovering ways in which we can autonomize movement and image processing using OpenCV and ROS 2
- Electrical team member for the Vanderbilt Aerospace Design Laboratory for the 25-26 NASA USLI Challenge
- Undergraduate Research Assistant at Vanderbilt Institutue for Surgery and Engineering<br>
