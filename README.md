# üí´ About Me:
I am a current sophomore at Vanderbilt University majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and minoring in Computer Science, with a concentrations in Embedded Software and Artificial Intelligence.<br><br>I have been intrigued by software development and its intersection with hardware ever since I started learning about the basic architecture of a computer from YouTube videos. Once I was introduced to an Arduino during my senior year of high school, is sparked my love and passion for the field of software development, which has grown ever since.<br>

# üöÄ What I'm Up To:
- Currently exploring Machine Learning with Sci-Kit Learn!
- Member of the Vandy Robotics Team in the Programming subteam, discovering ways in which we can autonomize movement and image processing using OpenCV and ROS 2
- Looking to collaborate on full-stack web applications<br>
